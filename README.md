# CrowdSphere

Ganache was used as a local blockchain and truffle to compile the smart contract. Web3.js library was used to interact with the smart contract and the frontend was designed with the help of react.js. It is basically a decentralized application that allows multiple users to contribute to a fund. People can contribute only through Ethereum cryptocurrency (ethers). And the fund's owner can withdraw the collected coins into his/her wallet at any time.
